MOST_JUNIT
==========

This is an offshoot of Jimkell's repo to include a JUNIT component for testing.

To be designed are:

- Automations for making sure certain files result in the same output when run through FBA or GDBB. This will make sure any new code maintains the core features.

- SBML Saving tests
